# Project 3: Casino


## Description

You have been assigned a team for this project. Teams must work together to produce a casino program based on the requirements provided below. Each team will have a team lead (a faculty member) who will provide some guidance and will require periodic reports but the bulk of the design and implementation of this project is the responsibility of the students. This project is a competition between teams and the end results will be judged after project submission.

## Requirements

Your casino must have the following features:

- At least three (3) games
  - One game must be a card game
  - One game must be a game of chance
  - You may choose the additional game(s)
- Casino patrons must be able to change the game they are playing without having to exit and restart the program

## Milestones:

Teams are required to report to their team lead at least once per weekday. More frequent check-ins with team members are heavily recommended.

1. All teams must have an initial UML design for the entire project approved by their team lead before any code may be written.
2. No code should be committed directly to the `master` branch of a repository without first being committed to a feature branch (another branch dedicated to development and testing of that feature) and code reviewed by at least one other team member. Approved, working code should be merged into `master` via a pull request from the appropriate feature branch.

## Judging:

This project is due on Monday, and will be judged on the basis of:

- UML for the project
- Test Driven Development
- DRY-ness of code (no excessively repetitive code)
- Object Oriented program design
- Implementation of polymorphic principles

Teams which engage in cowboy coding (implementing untested code with no plan and no UML) or which exclude team members from the development process will be penalized.

Final submissions must be in full working order, in the `master` branch of the team's GitHub repository.

It is each team's responsibility to be self-regulating to ensure good development practices, as well as progress toward a working final product.
